# Fun-coding-with-python
Here I am going to upload some really short and fun codes in python
If you are a beginner in python, you can use these codes, something different from the regular and boring codes. 
You will learn how vast python dependencies are.

For Pdf splitter code, download dependency: pip install PyPDF2.

For colour tracking code, download dependency: pip install opencv-python


For weather forecast ,download dependency: pip install selenium
Install webdriver, before that check the version you are using
For chrome click: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.o...
For firefox click: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodrive...


For sending bulk mails, download dependency: pip install pandas
                                             pip install xlrd
     Store the email ids in an excel sheet, mention the file name in the code, make the necessary changes(adding your own email and password), allow access to less trusted apps from your google account(just for the time being to check your code) and run it.
